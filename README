This project started out as a jump into JSON parsing in iOS. But quickly became an interesting application for searching the University of Cambridge's Library catalogue using their Newton search facility. 

As with other iOS applications you will have to have an Apple Developer account in order to install the application. It should run fine within the simulator if you just want to try it out.

The application is built for iOS 5 beta 6 at the moment and I will endeavour to keep this as up to date as possible. The released version will be built for the most up to date stable version of iOS. 

Pull requests should be dealt with quickly as usual. And any ideas would be great. 

REQUESTS:

	* UI - I am not a designer and therefore the UI is terrible. If anyone wants to have a go at tidying things up please do.
